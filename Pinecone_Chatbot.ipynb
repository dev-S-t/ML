Health, Inc. 2024 Resource Guide\\n\\n3\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc.\\n\\nIntroduction to the Guide Mid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. (MSBH) is pleased to present a revised 2024 edition of the Resource Guide for Behavioral Health Services in Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne’s, and Talbot Counties in Maryland. This guide, while not inclusive of every service or behavioral health provider in the five-county area, represents MSBH’s effort to help people in the community become more aware of the services that are available to them.\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. is a private, not-for-profit 501(c)(3) core service agency charged with overseeing the behavioral health systems and services in the mid-shore region, with some programs serving the nine-county region of Maryland’s Eastern Shore. MSBH was incorporated in 1992 through a collaboration of the five county governments and mental health stakeholders.\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc.’s Board of Directors consists of members appointed by the five local governments, five at-large members, and two charter members representing all stakeholders, including consumers, family members, or other residents of the five counties who possess some expertise in the field of behavioral health.\\n\\nMission Mid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc.’s mission is to continually improve the provision of behavioral health services for residents of Caroline, Dorchester, Kent, Queen Anne’s, and Talbot counties through effective coordination of care in collaboration with consumers, their natural support systems, family members, providers, and the community at large.\\n\\nVision Mid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc.’s vision is a rural behavioral healthcare delivery system that is clinically and culturally competent. This system will ensure access, have a community focus, be cost-effective, and be integrated to serve the community.\\n\\nWhat We Do Mid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. strives to enhance a regional behavioral health system of care through effective collaboration with consumers, providers, and community leaders. MSBH’s goal is to develop a full array of accessible services and resources for the consumer through partnership with our providers and other agencies. MSBH offers guidance in understanding and navigating all that is available in our community. Beyond the primary responsibility for local publicly funded mental health services, MSBH understands that behavioral health is essential to overall health, and many domains of life contribute to one’s behavioral health, especially having a home, purpose, and community connection. MSBH seeks to address the needs of the whole person and collaborates to improve the systems of care of the whole community throughout the region. The most important core value of our organization is hope: the belief that resiliency and recovery are real provides the essential and motivating message of a better future – that people and communities can and do overcome the internal and external challenges, barriers, and obstacles that confront them to achieve wellness.\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. 2024 Resource Guide\\n\\n4\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. Organizational Chart\\n\\nVisit Mid Shore Behavioral Health\\'s website for a list of current staff and career opportunities.\\n\\nCore Service Agency Overview\\n\\nWhat is a Core Service Agency? A Core Service Agency (CSA) is a state funded agency, as part of local health departments, local county governments, or non-profit organizations that operates under contract with the State of Maryland’s Behavioral Health Administration (BHA), a division of the Maryland Department of Health (MDH). The Annotated Code of Maryland Health General Article 10-1201 through 1203 mandates Core Service Agencies, Local Addictions Authorities, and Local Behavioral Health Authorities. Mid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc., as a CSA, functions under the MDH Secretary’s authority. Mid Shore Behavioral Health Inc. is a regional, non-profit CSA that serves five mid- shore counties and is the only regional CSA in the State. MSBH’s primary responsibility is community planning, management, and monitoring of publicly funded medically necessary behavioral health services in the five-county region for consumers across the life span: children, adolescents, adults, and the aging population. Optum Maryland Behavioral Health is the Administrative Services Organization (ASO), which is the organization under contract with the MDH Medicaid Office to process claims, enroll consumers, pre-authorize medically necessary services, credential providers, and pay claims.\\n\\nWho are the Consumers in the Public Behavioral Health System? The Public Behavioral Health System (PBHS) provides medically necessary services for people with Medical Assistance (Priority Partners) and for some individuals who are uninsured, or Medical Assistance Ineligible.\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. 2024 Resource Guide\\n\\n5\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. Services\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. works to connect people and consumers in need to behavioral health services by providing information about providers and treatment agencies in the local mid-shore region. Individuals experiencing mental health, substance use, homelessness, disabilities, or problem gambling challenges can visit MSBH’s website or call the main office for resources and assistance getting connected to behavioral health services. MSBH is not a behavioral health service provider.\\n\\nConsumers are individuals receiving behavioral health treatment and rehabilitation services within the fee for service Public Behavioral Health System (PBHS). Consumer assistance can be obtained by submitting a Consumer Support Service Request for pharmacy assistance, transportation to behavioral health-related appointments, laboratory costs as it relates to behavioral health treatments, and other support needs that help to achieve or stabilize community placement, which include one-time annual help with first month’s rent, security deposit, utility turn on or deposit, basic household goods to establish a residence, or past due utility, rent, or mortgage if the applicant can show sustainability, referred to as a \"special needs.\" All applications are subject to evaluation and approval. Incomplete applications will be denied and returned.\\n\\nMSBH can also assist with concerns regarding the services you or a family member are receiving. We first encourage you to discuss your concerns directly with the provider, however, if further assistance is needed, please call our office at 410-770-4801.\\n\\nIf you have been denied a service by Optum Maryland Behavioral Health, the Administrative Services Organization (ASO), you have the right to appeal that decision. Please refer to the MSBH website.\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health facilitates quarterly Behavioral Health Services Network (BHSN) meetings, where stakeholders discuss trends, changes, and issues concerning behavioral health in the Eastern Shore. The network comprises eight workgroups whose members include providers, consumers, and behavioral health professionals. All BHSN meetings are open to the public.\\n\\nThese workgroups are:\\n\\nAdult Services Workgroup • Children, Adolescents, and Young Adults Workgroup • Crisis Intervention Team Workgroup • Diversity and Inclusion Workgroup • Forensic Workgroup • Mid-Shore Roundtable on Homelessness • Mid-Shore Peer Workgroup • The People’s Roundtable\\n\\nVisit the BHSN page on the MSBH website for additional details and contact information for the workgroups. Those interested in helping build the best regional Public Behavioral Health System are encouraged to participate in these groups. If you would like to be added to MSBH’s bi-weekly newsletter to stay updated on mid-shore behavioral health-related meetings, trainings, and events, sign up for MSBH’s Steering Wheel newsletter on the MSBH website.\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. 2024 Resource Guide\\n\\n6\\n\\nBehavioral Health Acronyms & Terms\\n\\nFor a comprehensive Behavioral Health Glossary, visit MSBH’s website.\\n\\nAffordable Care Act ACA Assertive Community Treatment ACT ADHD Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder AHAR Annual Homeless Assessment Report Administrative Services Organization ASO Behavioral Health Administration BHA BHSN Behavioral Health Services Network Community Alternatives Framework CAF CASA Court Appointed Special Advocate CBT CCO CISM Critical Incident Stress Management CIT CME CMHP Community Mental Health Plan COC COMAR Code of Maryland Regulations Consumer Quality Team CQT Core Service Agency CSA Client Service Representative CSR Chesapeake Voyagers Inc.

Individuals eligible to participate are encouraged to voluntarily join the program with the knowledge that participation does not in itself reduce jail time. Program services are delivered by a licensed, master’s level clinician who is responsible for providing bio-psycho-educational treatment in accordance with the TAMAR program manual.

If you are found eligible for SSI, you are automatically eligible for Medical Assistance.\\n\\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI-Title II)\\n\\nSocial Security Disability Insurance (SSDI-Title II) is a federal government income support is also for those who have met eligibility requirements for disability but is based on the amount and recency of one\\'s past earnings. Benefits from a spouse\\'s record can be granted to a disabled widow over age 50, even if the widow has never been employed. Individuals who are disabled prior to age 18 may be able to draw on a disabled, deceased, or retired parent\\'s claim indefinitely.\\n\\nFor both entitlements, there is a complex application process and several eligibility requirements that must be met. The application process begins by contacting the local Social Security Office located at 828 Airpax Road Suite 500, Cambridge, Maryland 21613, visiting the website: www.ssa.gov/ssi, or calling 410-228-8811 or 1-800-772-1213 to request full information as well as forms to be mailed to you, and to schedule an appointment.\\n\\nInformation that you will need to submit: \\uf076 Original social security card and proof-of-age documents (no copies accepted). \\uf076 Full medical information including name, address and phone number of all physicians, hospitals, clinics, that have\\n\\nprovided treatment. This is needed to document your disability.\\n\\n\\uf076 Summary of employers and type of work performed during the previous 15 years. \\uf076 Copy of the previous year\\'s W-2 form from any employment. \\uf076 Proof of marriage if the spouse is applying.\\n\\nIt is recommended that the completed application and all accompanying and subsequent documentation be hand delivered to the Social Security office rather than mailed. You should request a receipt or some documentation from SSA. If applying for SSI, you will also need full information regarding financial assets: bank accounts, stocks, bonds, trust accounts and burial accounts or trusts. If you are living with family who help to support you, the monetary award will be less. Families are often contacted regarding how much support they provide. If a recipient of SSI obtains employment, Social Security must be notified immediately.\\n\\nSocial Security considers many factors in making awards, including ability to work and diagnosis. Some diagnoses qualify a person automatically; others require substantial documentation and may require a physical examination by a physician under contract with the Social Security Administration. The process of determining your disability is the same for SSI and SSDI. The process takes approximately 120 days and will include consideration of your ability to work in jobs other than the kind you may have done prior to becoming disabled.\\n\\nMid Shore Behavioral Health, Inc. 2024 Resource Guide\\n\\n142\\n\\nSOAR Initiative (SSI/SSDI Outreach, Access, and Recovery)\\n\\nSOAR, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) / Social Security Disability Benefits (SSDI) Outreach Access and Recovery, is a national program designed to increase access to Social Security Insurance (SSI) / Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) for adults who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness and have a mental illness, medical impairment, and/or a co-occurring substance use disorder.
